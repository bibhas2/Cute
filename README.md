Cute is a very simple C library to deal with dynamic String and Array.

These classes are meant to be used in small C programs where use of C++
or STL will be too much of a burden. Consequently, the libraries are small
and focus on high performance and low memory overhead.

There are no dependencies between the data types, such as String and Dictionary. This way,
you use just what you need.

One of the goals of this project is to be very careful about buffer overflow and 
memory allocation errors. If you notice any potential problems, please open an issue.
